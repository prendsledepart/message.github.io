            <p>I would like to take this opportunity to share some of my thoughts these days with you. 
               I know you ask me to give you some space and time to stay alone, but I think it's time to move forward.

                <p>Hey, Klay</p>
                <p>I appreciated that you came to visit me and spent my birthday with me last week, perhaps you couldn't tell how happy and grateful I was. 
                    Those three days when you were here were the happiest and most memorable days I ever had in the past year in Chicago. 
                    Strolled along with you in the familiar street, enjoyed the sights I see frequently, and tasted the food from places I've been or haven't been, in this city I live in. 
                    Everything appeared more wonderful than ever. All of these remind me of something I have heard “when you wonder if that person is the one, 
                    walk with him and you will feel a different and beautiful scenery.” Those three days fully show the appearance of the words.
                </p>

                <p>I also have a few things I want to talk about and apologize for. I feel like during those three days I had done something indecent and improperly. 
                    First, I had been dawdling over stuff a couple of times, I appreciate your patience in waiting for me. One of my bad habits was being a big procrastinator, and it takes time to alter that. 
                    Second, I showed my wayward side to you, that’s something I show to someone I’m close with. I’m not going to make any excuse for this, because I feel calm and without pressure when staying with you. 
                    Third, I’m too emotional and I can’t control my tears on my own at some points. I know you don’t like people tearing in front of you. 
                    I had been having a lot of trouble with that myself, most of the time I didn’t mean crying but my tears rolled faster than my mind asking them to stop.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, I was crying back then for a couple of different reasons. These factors are all entirely personal issues. 
                    First, I didn’t take the photos I expected. Why that’s a problem? Since I post on Instagram every year during my birthday, thus, I’m disappointed in myself. 
                    Second, we didn’t take enough photos together. Do you remember that I had a lighting string in my room with those photos we took in NY? 
                    I want to fill that wall with more photos, that’s why I brought the camera with me. Third, everything you did was amazing and surprising, those days are unreal and dreamy to me. 
                    On the day you are leaving, I realize I need to get back to reality and don’t want to face it. All I want is to stay in the fantasy for a bit longer, that’s why I persist to go to the airport with you.
                </p>
                <p>As I look back to the relationship we built, it has given me more courage to believe in myself and accept my strengths and weaknesses. 
                    I know I have more downsides that I didn’t mention. I want you to know that your advice is important and can help me make better improvements. 
                    Likewise, if you have any concerns or doubts, I will also stand by your side, support you, and listen to your thoughts. 
                    I wonder if you have the same idea? Everyone can make mistakes, but we can learn, grow, and move forward together.
                </p>
                <p>With love, Angel</p>
